This is the first post on my new blog. I built this blog to share my thoughts on startups, engineering, and life.

## Why a blog?

Writing helps me think. It forces me to organize my thoughts and articulate ideas clearly.

## Code example

Here's some code to test syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

And some Python:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## What's next

Stay tuned for more posts about building startups, writing code, and navigating life as a founder.
